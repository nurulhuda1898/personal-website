<p align="center"> Bagan Datuk is a town about 45km west of Teluk Intan,Hilir Perak. It is located in the southwest city of Ipoh,the capital of Perak. My family and I almost come to Bagan Datuk appriximately one year in two times. This place provided for family spend their time while looking at the view of the Perak River.In addition, this place also provided replica of a ship like Kapal Samuedara at Malacca. This space provided for visitor take a picture with family and also have space playground for children. This place has just opened because not many people know where it is. But every weekend in night this area is full of people but mostly people in near area get together.
