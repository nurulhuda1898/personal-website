<p align="center">After finish SPM 2015,I had the opportunity to study at STPM level for batch 2016/2017 at the same school during SPM. I have finish my study at STPM level for 2 years until graduation day. During STPM I took the course like Geography, History, Malay language and Pengajian Am. But, I does not have luck for continuing studies to Degree level. My result was unsatisfactory maybe because I not be a serius when study and I think because STPM level is so tough because we need struggler and focus for study only for 3 semestar. But it's ok because I can gain an experience along my effort to gain useful knowledge to be a knowledgeable person.
